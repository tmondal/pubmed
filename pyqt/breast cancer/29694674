This review was originallypublished in 2012 and updated in 2017.OBJECTIVES: To compare local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versusconventional analgesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months in adultsand children undergoing elective surgery.SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to December 2016 withoutany language restriction. We used a combination of free text search andcontrolled vocabulary search. We limited results to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We updated this search in December 2017, but these results have not yetbeen incorporated in the review. We conducted a handsearch in reference lists of included studies, review articles and conference abstracts. We searched thePROSPERO systematic review registry for related systematic reviews.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing local or regional anaesthesiaversus conventional analgesia with a pain outcome beyond three months afterelective, non-orthopaedic surgery.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data and adverse events. We contacted study authorsfor additional information. We presented outcomes as pooled odds ratios (OR) with95% confidence intervals (95% CI), based on random-effects models (inversevariance method). We analysed studies separately by surgical intervention, butpooled outcomes reported at different follow-up intervals. We compared ourresults to Bayesian and classical (frequentist) models. We investigatedheterogeneity. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.MAIN RESULTS: In this updated review, we identified 40 new RCTs and seven ongoingstudies. In total, we included 63 RCTs in the review, but we were only able tosynthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP beyond threemonths after surgery from 41 studies, enrolling a total of 3143 participants inour inclusive analysis.Evidence synthesis of seven RCTs favoured epiduralanaesthesia for thoracotomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP three to 18 monthsfollowing an epidural for thoracotomy were 0.52 compared to not having anepidural (OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants, moderate-qualityevidence). Simlarly, evidence synthesis of 18 RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancersurgery with an OR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, 1297 participants, low-qualityevidence). Pooling data at three to 8 months after surgery from four RCTsfavoured regional anaesthesia after caesarean section with an OR of 0.46, (95% CI0.28 to 0.78; 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis ofthree RCTs investigating continuous infusion with local anaesthetic for theprevention of PPP three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting(ICBG) was inconclusive (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09; 123 participants,low-quality evidence). However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion of intravenous local anaesthetics for the prevention of PPP three to sixmonths after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97participants, moderate-quality evidence).We did not synthesize evidence for thesurgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery andlaparotomy. We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the includedstudies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. Clinicalheterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis.High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number ofincluded studies reduced our confidence in the findings. Thus results must beinterpreted with caution.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence thatregional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP after three to 18months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section. There islow-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery. There is moderate evidencethat intravenous infusion of local anaesthetics may reduce the risk of developingPPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery.Our conclusions areconsiderably weakened by the small size and number of studies, by performancebias, null bias, attrition and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies,including children, are needed. We caution that except for breast surgery, ourevidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies. On a cautionary note, wecannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions or regionalanaesthesia techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral blockreduces the risk of PPP after thoracotomy. There are seven ongoing studies and 12studies awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the currentreview once they are published and incorporated.DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub3 PMCID: PMC6080861 [Available on 2019-04-25]PMID: 29694674  [Indexed for MEDLINE]
